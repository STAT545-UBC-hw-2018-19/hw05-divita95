#### Load packages



The following packages were used for this assignment:



```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(kableExtra))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(reshape2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))
```


Goals:

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
- Write some data to file and load it back into R.
- Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
- Make a plotly visual.
- Implement visualization design principles.


### **Part1: Factor Management**

With the data set of your choice, after ensuring the variable(s) youâ€™re exploring are indeed factors, you are expected to:

1. Drop factor / levels;
2. Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

**1. Drop Levels**

Initially, the origial gapminder data was explored to extract some basic informations.


```{r}
# information of the data before removing factors
levels(gapminder$continent)
nrow(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
```



It can be concluded that the gapminder data set has 5 levels of continents. It consists of 1704 rows and 6 columns. 


Now, lets drop on of the continent levels: Oceania



```{r}
# dropping levels

new_data <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania") %>% 
  droplevels()

# representing in the form if tables
knitr::kable(table(new_data$continent), col.names = c("Continent","Number of Countries")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", latex_options = "basic", full_width = F)

```


```{r}
#information on the newdata formed after dropping levels

str(new_data)
nrow(new_data)
levels(new_data$continent)
dim(new_data)
```



It can be seen that using `droplevels()` the number of levels changed to 4 whereas if we has used `filter()` function, the number of levels would still be 5. Thus, dropping factors helps in sorting the data and easier to analyse.




**2. Reordering the data**


For this exercise, we used the standard deviation of gdpPercap for each continents and tried to arrange and reorder the data.


```{r}
## standard deviation of a quantitative variable- gdpPercap

SD <- new_data %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(SD_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap))
knitr::kable(SD, col.names = c("Continent","SD of gdpPercap")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", latex_options = "basic", full_width = F)
```


```{r}
# visualising the change of SD within the continents

ggplot(SD, aes(continent, SD_gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Standard Deviation of gdpPercap wrt to Continents")
```


```{r}
#arranging the data

arrange_data <- new_data %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(SD_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  arrange(SD_gdpPercap)
knitr::kable(arrange_data, col.names = c("Continent","SD of gdpPercap")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", latex_options = "basic", full_width = F)
```

```{r}
ggplot(arrange_data, aes(continent, SD_gdpPercap )) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Standard Deviation of gdpPercap wrt to Continents")
```

```{r}
#reordering the data

fctreorder_data <- new_data %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(SD_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, SD_gdpPercap))
knitr::kable(fctreorder_data, col.names = c("Continent","SD of gdpPercap")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", latex_options = "basic", full_width = F)
```


```{r}
ggplot(fctreorder_data, aes(continent, SD_gdpPercap )) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Standard Deviation of gdpPercap wrt to Continents")
```
 
```{r}
#reorder and arranging the data

arrange_reorder_data <- new_data %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(SD_gdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, SD_gdpPercap)) %>% 
  arrange(SD_gdpPercap)
knitr::kable(arrange_reorder_data, col.names = c("Continent","SD of gdpPercap")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", latex_options = "basic", full_width = F)

  
```


```{r}
ggplot(arrange_reorder_data, aes(continent, SD_gdpPercap )) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Standard Deviation of gdpPercap wrt to Continents")
```


**Observations:** It was observed that `arrange()` function arranges the data from the lowest to the highest value of `SD_gdppercap` that is in ascending order. The use of `fct_reorder()` did not affect the original order of the data while using `arrange()` and `fct_reorder()` together it was observed that the data was ordered in the same way as using `arrange()` alone. Therefore, `fct_reorder` didnot have much effect on the data.



#### **Part2: FileI/O**


Experiment with one or more of write_csv()/read_csv() (and/or TSV friends), saveRDS()/readRDS(), dput()/dget(). Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Gapminder.




For this exercise, lets output the maximum lifeExp of each continent and then read it back again.


```{r}
file<- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp))
knitr::kable(file, col.names = c("Continent","maximum lifeExp")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", latex_options = "basic", full_width = F)
```


```{r}
write_csv(file, "file_csv.csv")
file_csv <- read_csv("file_csv.csv")
file_csv
```



We observe that the output is same in both the cases.


Trying on `saveRDS`, `dput()/dget()` functions 


```{r}
saveRDS(file, "file_rds.rds")

file_rds <- readRDS("file_rds.rds")
file_rds
```

```{r}
dput(file, "file.txt")

file_get <- dget("file.txt")
file_get
```


We can see that all the above functions give the same output as the original output.



#### **Part3: Visualisation Design**


Creating a plot of lifeExp v/s gdpPercap and modifying the plot using visualistaion design recently learned in class.

The plot shows the relation between lifeExp and gdpPercap for each continent using facet_wrap.


```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, gdpPercap )) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) +
  labs(title = "Plot of lifeExp versus gdpPercap for the continents")
```



The use of visuale design on the above graph made the analyses easier. The graph below was extracted from the above but some extra features were added. The y_scale was changed to `logarithm_scale` which gave a clear and broader picture as compared to the above one. Also using palette color for `pop` helped us determine the number of people with a particular lifeExp range.




```{r}
figure <-gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, gdpPercap )) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  geom_point(aes(color = pop)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=dollar_format()) +
  scale_colour_distiller(
         trans   = "log10",
         breaks  = 10^(1:10),
         labels  = comma_format(),
         palette = "Blues"
     ) +
 scale_y_log10(breaks=10*(1:10)) +
     theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Plot of lifeExp versus gdpPercap for the continents")
figure
```



Next, we convert the above graph into a plotly plot.


```{r}
library(plotly)
#ggplotly(p)

```




#### **Part4: Writing figures to files**


Use ggsave() to explicitly save a plot to file. Then use embed it in your report.


Firstly, we use `ggsave()` to save the above figure as a `.png` file



```{r}
ggsave("my_plot.png", plot = figure, width = 10, height = 5, dpi = 100)
```


Next, we embed the plot in this report.
